 Bugs
 - Enter category name was not cleared even after click cancel button on create new category page
 
 New Ideas / Improvement
 - No nominal separator based on currency selected
 - Only allow 9 digit nominal no matter what the currency, could be a problem for some currency that have bigger digits
 - Lack of alert. For example no alert when user do divided numbers with zero
 - Not flexible recurring options. For example: no hourly, no every three weeks, no every four months, no every five months, etc.
 - Not flexible reminder options. For example: no reminder for hourly, no reminder for n-days before, no reminder for n-weeks before, etc.
 
 Conclusion
 - No critial issues/bugs found during this testing. Mostly app working as expected according to general logic.
 - There are still so many room for improvement as mention in New Ideas/Improvement section to avoid ambiguity on user journey.
